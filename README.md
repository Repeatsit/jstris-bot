# jstris-bot

WIP bot that plays [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/). Written in Python 3, uses Misamino as AI.

Only tested on GNU/Linux.

## Usage

- Compile my fork of jez's Misamino fork (will upload later) and place it alongside the script
- Install dependencies: mss, pillow, keyboard
- Configure GRID_START and NEXT_START on the script to match your screen coords
- Make sure the entire Jstris field and next pieces are unobstructed (no windows on top etc.)
- Set Jstris controls to default, soft-drop to instant, ghost enabled, no skin
- Run bot and focus browser window
